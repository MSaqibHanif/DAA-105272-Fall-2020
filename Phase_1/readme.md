======= Project Phase 1: Max overload========

Aim:
-------
This is assignment is aimed to get you a flavor of efficiency of algorithms. To achieve this, you will be implementing different algorithms that solves the modification to the classic N-Queen Problem discussed in assignment 1. The first and most fundamental algorithm is to use brute force which you have already done. The other solution is Backtracking which you will implement now. 

Assessment Objectives:
--------------------------------------
The assignment is geared to test how well you understand an algorithm and able to implement it. Secondly how well can you analyze the algorithm implemented on its time and complexity. On the side, you will also be assessed on your use of GitHub, and participation on GitHub.
