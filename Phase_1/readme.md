## What is backtracking?
Backtracking is finding the solution of a problem whereby the solution depends on the previous steps taken. For example, in a maze problem, the solution depends on all the steps you take one-by-one. If any of those steps is wrong, then it will not lead us to the solution. In a maze problem, we first choose a path and continue moving along it. But once we understand that the particular path is incorrect, then we just come back and change it. This is what backtracking basically is.

In backtracking, we first take a step and then we see if this step taken is correct or not i.e., whether it will give a correct answer or not. And if it doesnâ€™t, then we just come back and change our first step. In general, this is accomplished by recursion. Thus, in backtracking, we first start with a partial sub-solution of the problem (which may or may not lead us to the solution) and then check if we can proceed further with this sub-solution or not. If not, then we just come back and change it.

The general steps of backtracking are:

start with a sub-solution
check if this sub-solution will lead to the solution or not
If not, then come back and change the sub-solution and continue again

## N queens on NxN chessboard
One of the most common examples of the backtracking is to arrange N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no queen can strike down any other queen. A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The solution to this problem is also attempted in a similar way. We first place the first queen anywhere arbitrarily and then place the next queen in any of the safe places. We continue this process until the number of unplaced queens becomes zero (a solution is found) or no safe place is left. If no safe place is left, then we change the position of the previously placed queen.
